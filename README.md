This is my first React project, it's a simple to do list. 
It has local storage so you can keep your todos, states to update the things you already accomplished and a delete option if you added a todo by mistake. You can also filter by 'all', 'completed' or 'uncompleted'.
The styling is made with SASS modules to each component.
